# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

pod_digest is a podcast newsletter project currently in its initial setup phase. The repository contains only the basic MIT license and a minimal README indicating it will be a "podcast newsletter" application.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository with no code implementation yet. When developing this project, consider:

1. The project name suggests it will digest/summarize podcast content into newsletter format
2. No technology stack has been chosen yet - evaluate requirements before selecting frameworks
3. The MIT license allows for flexible development approaches

## Development Setup

Since no code exists yet, when implementing this project:

1. First determine the technology stack based on requirements (e.g., Python for audio processing, Node.js for web services, etc.)
2. Set up appropriate project structure and configuration files
3. Implement build, test, and lint tooling as part of initial setup
4. Create documentation as features are developed

## Next Steps

When beginning development:
- Clarify the specific requirements for podcast processing and newsletter generation
- Choose appropriate technologies for audio processing, content generation, and distribution
- Set up project infrastructure (package management, testing framework, CI/CD)
- Implement core functionality incrementally with proper testing
